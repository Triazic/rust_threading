# Lorel

## Character Traits
Themed around a connection with royalty (real or imagined), arrogance, cleanliness. 
Lorel may not be her real name. Potential delusions of grandeur. Enjoyed chess as a child. 
Initially has no reason to accompany the party, potentially acts as an enemy. Perhaps gets kicked out of her circles later on. 

## Combat
Themed around:
- arrogance (Kneel ability)
- cleanliness, not wanting to be around plebs (Unsoiled passive)
- chess (Queen's Rush, King for a Day abilities) 

Very low base movement (2). Queen's Rush can be used as a movement ability. 
Lorel's class would be a good secondary class for a class also without good movement, as Queen's Rush can compensate.  

## Traits
- Unsoiled: loses 5% HP if a unit (friendly or enemy) is next to her. If the target has the Kneeling or Servitude token, gain 10% health.  
- Can only use Rapiers or Bags as weapons
- Rapiers and Bags ordinarily have a range of 1. When used by Lorel, they have a range of 2. 
- Stepping Stone. Can use other units (friendly or enemy) as platforms / stepping stones to reach higher places. 

## Abilities
- Kneel. Physical attack, using physical weapon range. Hits at the targets legs. The target receives a Kneeling token. 
- Kiss the Ring, usable by enemies with the Kneeling token. Range 1. Only Lorel targetable. Replaces the Kneeling token with a Servitude token. Grants Lorel a Grandeur token.
- Queen's Rush. Physical attack, range 5. Lorel moves and strikes either straight ahead, backwards, left, right, or diagonally.  
  If used on an empty tile, then Lorel will move to that tile as a free action.  
- King for a Day. Lorel receives a Kingly token. Free action, ends current turn.   
  Max Uses: 1
- Checkmate (if Lorel has Kingly token). Range 1.  
  If the target is a normal or Elite enemy, move to the target's location and remove them from the battlefield. 
  If the target is a boss, deal massive physical damage.
