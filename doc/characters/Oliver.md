## Oliver

### Character Traits
High-functioning depression / malaise.  
Gloomy theme but not necessarily dark / evil, positive intentions to others.  
See eg. abilities Nostalgia, Reach Out, Cautious Optimism, For You. 

### Combat
Themed around making the enemies depressed while marching through his own struggles.  
Abilities are speech-based similar to the Orator class of FFT.   
** You merely adopted the darkness, I was born in it ** vibes  
Oliver's abilities are based around applying debuffs to both enemies and himself.  
He is used to being debuffed so they affect himself at half potency.    
Typical use would be applying mass debuffs to the enemy and himself during the start of the battle, and Venting them off of himself mid-battle.

## Tokens
- Ponder: the bearer of this token takes twice as long (+100%) to execute charged / channeled abilities but they do 50% more damage when executed. If at half potency, only the time component is reduced to +50%.  
** if used well, Oliver can simultaneously debuff an enemy caster and buff his own abilities ** 
- Project: when the bearer is affected by an ability which would inflict a negative token, the user of that ability receives the negative token instead.    
  ** It's you that is the problem ** ** No, you ** 
- Misery: ?
- Malaise: the bearer of this token has their speed reduced by 50% for two turns and their movement will be reduced by 2 (maybe also they have a 50% chance to be unable to act). Halving the potency will halve these values. 
- Nostalgia: the bearer yearns for the past. On the bearer's turn, their health and active tokens will return to what they were on their previous turn and the Nostalgia token will be removed. * If used well, this can deny recently used healing and buffs on the target, 
and undo recent damage / debuffs to Oliver * 
- Solastalgia: ? 
- Grief: ?
- Cautious Optimism: the bearer's Fortune is increased by 5 and healing received increased by 20% for five turns. If the bearer is affected by a Low Fortune event (below a 2 roll), the token is replaced by a Grief / Malaise token. 
- Shame: the bearer cannot accept help from others. Positive tokens cannot be applied to the bearer by other units. 
The bearer cannot be healed by other units. If at half potency, positive tokens will be Weakened, and healing will be reduced by 50%. 
- Reach Out: when targeted by a healing ability, the potency of the healing applied is doubled and the Reach Out token is replaced by a Shame token. 
- Catastrophise: the bearer dreams of an impending calamity. If this token is not removed within three turns
(six turns if at half potency), the calamity will transpire. The bearer will be hit by a meteor. The damage taken scales off of the bearer's intelligence.
- Bound: creates a bond between both units sharing this token. If either unit possessing this token dies, both units die. 
or:
- Protected / Bound: if the bearer of the Protected token dies, the bearer of the Bound token (Oliver) dies instead.
- Nihilist / Atheist: the bearer cannot bring themselves to believe. Magical abilities of all kinds including healing and damage have no effect on the bearer,  
and the bearer cannot use magical abilities of their own.
