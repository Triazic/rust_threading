## Tokens
- Ponder: the bearer of this token takes twice as long (+100%) to execute charged / channeled abilities but they do 50% more damage when executed. If at half potency, only the time component is reduced to +50%.  
- Misery: ?
- Malaise: the bearer of this token has their speed reduced by 50% for two turns and their movement will be reduced by 2 (maybe also they have a 50% chance to be unable to act). Halving the potency will halve these values. 
- Nostalgia: the bearer yearns for the past. On the bearer's turn, their health and active tokens will return to what they were on their previous turn and the Nostalgia token will be removed. * If used well, this can deny recently used healing and buffs on the target, 
and apply healing / buffs to Oliver * 
- Grief: ?
- Shame: the bearer cannot accept help from others. Positive tokens cannot be applied to the bearer by other units. 
The bearer cannot be healed by other units. If at half potency, positive tokens will be Weakened, and healing will be reduced by 50%. 
- Catastrophise: the bearer dreams of an impending calamity. If this token is not removed within three turns
(six turns if at half potency), the calamity will transpire. The bearer will be hit by a meteor. The damage taken scales off of the bearer's intelligence.
- Bound: creates a bond between both units sharing this token. If either unit possessing this token dies, both units die. 
or:
- Protected / Bound: if the bearer of the Protected token dies, the bearer of the Bound token (Oliver) dies instead.
